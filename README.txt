# TextUno
A text-based Uno game that I made for Data Structure course.
Also for when you do not have someone to play Uno with :D

This game only runs in terminal.

## If you wish to try it, here is how to do so:
__Requirement:__ Java JDK 12.0.2 or newer 
1) Open terminal and redirect to wherever you put this game folder in your machine
2) Type all these in the terminal "javac -d . Card.java", "javac -d . MiniDeck.java", "javac -d FullDeck.java", "javac -d PlayersHand.java"
3) (Optional) If you want to play with the full deck (100 cards), open Gameplay.java with a text/code editor and delete the first "//" on line 41. Then add "//" at the start of line 42. __If you want to undo that and play with the mini deck (24 cards), just add "//" at the start of line 41 and delete the "//" you added in line 42.__
4) Then type 
      > java finaleproj.Gameplay
5) Have fun!
